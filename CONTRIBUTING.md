# How to contribute

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version
  unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have
  your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself in
  another branch so I can ignore when I pull.
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
